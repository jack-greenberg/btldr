# Hello Manu

You'll see that I am rewriting the bootloader that we found to be a bit more readable and more specific to just our chip.

I could use your help rewriting the libraries:

- CAN library (or maybe just want to use the Formula CAN lib)
- CAN ISP library (like the sort of UDS thing)
- Flash library
